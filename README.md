JakyKit is a small, learning-focused collection of native Web Components built without frameworks.
Its goal is to explore how modern, reusable UI components can be implemented using only:
- Custom Elements
- Shadow DOM
- HTML templates
- CSS encapsulation
- Modern browser APIs

This project serves as both a personal learning playground and a mini component library.

Foundational UI components

Reusable base components such as:
x-button — a customizable button with encapsulated styles
x-input — a labeled text input with slot-based helper text
x-card — a lightweight content container used to group text, images, or other components.
